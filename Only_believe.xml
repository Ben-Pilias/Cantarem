refrain=""
>Fear not, little flock, from the cross to
the throne, From death into life He
went for His own; All power in earth,
all power above, Is given to Him for
the flock of His love.

CHORUS
Only believe, only believe,
All things are possible, only
believe;
Only believe, only believe,
All things are possible, only
believe.
(Lord, I believe . . . )
(Lord, I receive . . .)
(Jesus is here . . . )

Fear not, little flock, He goeth ahead,
Your Shepherd selecteth the path you
must tread; The waters of Marah He’ll
sweeten for thee, He drank all the
bitter in Gethsemane.

Fear not, little flock, whatever your lot,
He enters all rooms, “the doors being
shut;” He never forsakes, He never is
gone, So count on His presence in
darkness and dawn.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="AMAZING GRACE" numero="2" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>Amazing grace! How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me! I once
was lost, but now am found, Was
blind, but now I see.

Twas grace that taught my heart to
fear, And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believe!

Through many dangers, toils and
snares, I have already come; ‘Tis grace
hath brought me safe thus far, And
grace will lead me home.

When we’ve been there ten thousand
years,  Bright shining as the sun;
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="THEY COME" numero="3" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>They come from the East and West,
They come from the lands afar, To
feast with the King, to done as His
guest; How blessed these pilgrims are!
Beholding His hallowed face, Aglow
with light divine; Blest partakers of His
grace, As gems in His crown to shine.

CHORUS
Since Jesus has set me free,
I’m happy as heart can be;
No longer I bear the burden of
care,
His yoke is so sweet to me.
My soul was as black as night.
But darkness has taken flight;
Now I shout the victory,
For Jesus has set me free.

I look on the great white throne,
Before it the ransom’d stand; No
longer are tears, no sorrow is known
Nor death in that goodly land. My
Saviour has gone before, Preparing the
way for me; Soon we’ll meet to part
no more Thru time or eternity.

The gates of that holy place Stand
open by night and day; O look to the
Lord who “giveth more grace,”
Whose love has prepared the way. A
home in those mansions fair His hand
hath reserve for all. For the wedding
feast prepare, Obeying the gracious
call.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="I LOVE HIM" numero="4" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>Gone from my heart the world and all
its charms; Now, through the blood,

I’m saved from all alarms; Down at
the cross my heart is bending low; The
precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.

CHORUS

I love Him, I love Him
Because He first loved me
And purchased my salvation
On Calvary’s tree.

Once I was lost, and ‘way down deep
in sin; Once was a slave to passions
fierce within, Once was afraid to trust
a loving God; But now I’m cleansed
from every stain through Jesus’ blood.

Once I was bound, but now I am set
free; Once I was blind, but now the
light I see; Once I was dead, but now
in Christ I live, To tell the world
around the peace that he doth give.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="SWEET HOUR OF PRAYER" numero="5" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of
prayer, That calls me from a world of
care, And bids me, at my Father’s
throne, Make all my wants and wishes
known; In seasons of distress and
grief, My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter’s snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of
prayer, The joy I feel, the bliss I share,
Of those whose anxious spirits burn
With strong desires for thy return!
With such I hasten to the place Where
God, my Saviour, shows His face,
And gladly take my station there, And
wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer.

Sweet hour of prayer, sweet hour of
prayer, Thy wings shall my petition
bear   To Him whose truth and
faithfulness Engage the waiting soul to bless;

And since He bids me seek His
face, Believe His Word and trust His
grace, I’ll cast on Him my every care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of
prayer.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="OH, HOW I LOVE JESUS" numero="6" auteur="" reference="" gamme=""

>There is a name I love to hear, I love
to sing its worth; It sounds like music
in mine ear, The sweetest name on
earth.

CHORUS
Oh, how I love Jesus,
Oh, how I love Jesus,
Oh, how I love Jesus,
Because He first love me.
(I’ll never forsake Him . . .

It tells me of a Saviour’s love, Who
died to set me free; It tells me of His
precious blood; The sinner’s perfect
plea.

It tells me what my Father hath in store
for every day, And though I tread a
darksome path, yields sunshine all the
way.

It tells of One whose loving heart Can
feel my deepest woe, Who in each
sorrow bears a part, That none can
bear below.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="WHEN THE REDEEMED GATHER" numero="7" auteur="" reference="" gamme=""

>I am thinking of the rapture in our
blessed home on high, When the
redeemed are gathering in; How we’ll
raise the heavenly anthem in that city in
the sky.  When the redeemed are
gathering in.

CHORUS

When the redeemed are gathering in,
Washed like the snow, and free
from all sin;
How we will shout, and how we
will sing,
When the redeemed are gathering
in.

There will be a great procession over
on the streets of gold, When the
redeemed are gathering in; O what
music, O what singing, o’er the city will
be rolled. When the redeemed are
gathering in.

Saints will sing redemption’s story with
their voices clear and strong, When
the redeemed are gathering in; Then
the angels all will listen, For they
cannot join that song, When the
redeemed are gathering in.

Then the Saviour will give orders to
prepare the banquet board, When the
redeemed are gathering in; And we’ll
hear His invitation, “Come, ye blessed
of the Lord,” When the redeemed are
gathering in.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="OH, I WANT TO SEE HIM" numero="8" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>As I journey through the land, singing
as I go, Pointing souls to Calvary, to
the crimson flow, Many arrows pierce
my soul from without, within; But my
Lord leads me on, through Him I
must win.

CHORUS
Oh. I want to see Him, look
upon His face.
There to sing forever of His
saving grace;
On the streets of Glory let me lift
my voice.
Cares all past, home at last, ever to
rejoice.

When in service for my Lord, dark may
be the night. But I’ll cling more close
to Him, He will give me light; Satan’s
snares may vex my soul, turn my
thoughts aside; But my Lord goes
ahead, leads whate’er betide.

When in valleys low I look toward the
mountain height, And behold my
Saviour there, leading in the fight.
With a tender hand outstretched
toward the valley low; Guiding me, I
can see, as I onward go.

When before me billows rise from the
mighty deep. Then my Lord directs
my bark, He doth safely keep. And He
leads me gently on through this world
below; He’s a real Friend to me, O I
love Him so.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="FEELING SO MUCH BETTER" numero="9" auteur="" reference="" gamme=""

this food old Way, Feeling so much
better talking about the Lord; Let’s go
on, let’s go on talking about this good
old Way, Let’s go on, let’s go on
talking about the Lord.

The devil he don’t like it, talking about
this good old Way. The devil he don’t
like it, talking about the Lord; So, let’s
go on, let’s go on talking bout this
good old Way, Let’s go on, let’s go on
talking about the Lord.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="TEACH ME, LORD, TO WAIT" numero="10" auteur="" reference="" gamme=""

>Teach me, Lord, to wait down on my
knees. Till in Your own good time
You answer my pleas; Teach me not
to rely on what others do, But to wait
in prayer for an answer from You.

CHORUS
They that wait upon the Lord,
shall renew their strength,
They shall mount up with wings
as an eagle.
They shall run and not be weary,
they shall walk and not faint;
Teach me, Lord, teach me, Lord, to
wait.

Teach me, Lord, to wait while hearts
are aflame, Help me humble my pride
and call on Your name; Keep my faith
renewed, keep my eyes on Thee, Help
me be on this earth what You want me
to be.</cantique>

We shall rise! ( Amen! )
We shall rise! ( Hallelujah! )

Hallelujah! ) we shall rise.

In the resurrection morning, Blessed

In the resurrection morning, We shall

bright and fair,  We shall rise, (
Hallelujah! ) we shall rise.</cantique>

CHORUS
And when the battle’s over, we

Yes, we shall wear a crown! Yes,
we shall wear a crown In the new
Jerusalem.
Wear a crown, wear a crown. And
when the battle’s over, we shall

In the new Jerusalem.

Must I be carried to the skies On
flow’ry beds of ease, While others
fought to win the prize, And sailed
through bloody seas?

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood? Is this vile
world a friend to grace To help me on
to God?

Sure I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord; I’ll bear
the toil, endure the pain, Supported by
Thy Word.</cantique>

Grace that exceeds our sin and our
guilt  Yonder on Calvary’s mount

the Lamb was spilt.

CHORUS
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that will pardon and
cleanse within;
Grace, grace, God’s grace,
Grace that is greater than all our
sin.

Sin and despair like the sea waves cold,
Threaten the soul with infinite loss;
Grace that is greater, yes, grace untold,
Points to the Refuge, the Mighty Cross.

Dark is the stain that we cannot hide,
What can avail to wash it away? Look!
There is flowing a crimson tide;
Whiter than snow you may be today.

Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace,
Freely bestowed on all who believe;
You that are longing to see His face,
Will you this moment His grace
receive?</cantique>

Where gates of pearl swing open wide,
And when I’ve passed this vale of
sorrow, I’ll camp upon the other side.

CHORUS
Some day beyond the reach of
mortal ken,
Some day, God only knows just
where and when,
The wheels of mortal life shall all
stand still.
And I shall go to dwell on Zion’s
hill.

Some day I’ll hear the angels singing,
Beyond the shadows of the tomb;
And all the bells of heaven ringing,
While saints are singing, “Home, sweet
Home.”

Some day my labors will be ended,
and all my wand’rings will be o’er, And
all earth’s broken ties be mended, And
I shall sigh and weep no more.

Some day the dark clouds will be rifted,
And all the night of gloom be past;
And all life’s burdens will be lifted,
The day of rest shall dawn at last.</cantique>

CHORUS
We’re marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We’re marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

Let those refuse to sing Who never
knew our God; But children of the
heavenly King, But children of the
heavenly King, May speak their joys
abroad, May speak their joys abroad.

The hill of Zion yields A thousand
sacred sweets Before we reach the
heavenly fields, Before we reach the
heavenly fields, Or walk the golden
streets, Or walk the golden streets.

Then let our songs abound, And every
tear be dry; We’re marching thru
Immanuel’s ground, We’re marching
thru Immanuel’s ground, To fairer
worlds on high, To fairer worlds on
high.</cantique>

wicked way in me, Cleanse me from
every sin, and set me free.

I praise Thee, Lord, for cleansing me
from sin; Fulfill Thy Word, and make
me pure within; Fill me with fire,
where once I burned with shame;
Grant my desire to magnify Thy
Name.

Lord, take my life, and make it wholly
Thine; Fill my poor heart with Thy
great love divine; Take all my will, my
passion, self and pride;   I now
surrender; Lord, in me abide.

O Holy Ghost, revival comes from
Thee; Send a revival, start the work in
me; Thy Word declares Thou wilt
supply our need; For blessing now, O
Lord, I humbly plead.</cantique>

CHORUS
My sheep know My voice,
And day by day,
They abide in the fold,
And go not astray;
They love Me because
I have made them My choice,
And they follow My call,
For My sheep know My voice.

My sheep know My voice, And the
pastures of green, Where I lead them
so often to feed; My sheep know My
voice, And the cool sparkling stream,
Where beside its still waters I lead.

My sheep know My voice, And the
valley of death, Thru which I shall lead
them some day; But no danger nor
harm Can touch one of them, For I
will be with them always.</cantique>

CHORUS
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.

Like a mighty army Moves the Church
of God; Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod; We are

hope and doctrine, One in charity.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane; But the
Church of Jesus Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never ‘Gainst that
church prevail; We have Christ’s own
promise, Which can never fail.

At the sign of triumph, Satan’s host
doth flee; Oh, then Christian soldiers,
On to victory!  Hell’s foundations
quiver   At the shout of praise;
Brothers, lift your voices, Loud your
anthems raise!

Onward, then, ye people! Join our
happy throng; Blend with ours your

laud, and honor, Unto Christ the King;
This through countless ages Men and

Will his coming bring rejoicing? Or

Will you join in lamentation? Or the

Help to gather in the grain then withjoy you’ll meet the Saviour, When our

soldiers,
And face to face in stern array,
With armor gleaming, and colors

The fight is on, but be not weary,
Be strong and in his might hold

If God be for us, his banner o’er

We’ll sing the victor’s song at last.

The fight is on, arouse ye soldiers
brave and true, Jehovah leads, and
vict’ry will assure; Go buckle on the

>I heard an old, old story, How a
Saviour came from glory, how he gave
His life on Calvary To save a wretch

Of His precious blood’s atoning, Then
I repented of my sins And won the
victory.

CHORUS
O victory in Jesus.
My Saviour, forever,
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood;
He loved me ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him,
He plunged me to victory,
Beneath the cleansing flood.

I heard about His healing,  Of His
cleansing pow’r revealing, how he
made the lame to walk again And
caused the blind to see; And then I
cried, “Dear Jesus, Come and heal my
broken spirit,” And somehow Jesus
came and brought To me the victory.

I hard about a mansion He has built
for me in glory, And I heard about the
streets of gold Beyond the crystal sea;
About the angels singing, And the old
redemption story, And some sweet
day I’ll sing up there The song of
victory.</cantique>

May Thy rich grace impart Strength to

Thou hast died for me, O may my
love to Thee,  Pure, warm, and
changeless be, A living fire!

Wipe sorrow’s tears away, Nor let me
ever stray From Thee aside.</cantique>

Living by faith, in Jesus above,
Trusting, confiding in His great

From all harm safe in His

I’m living by faith and feel no

Though tempest may blow and the
storm clouds arise, Obscuring the
brightness of life. I’m never alarmed at

I know that he safely will carry me

Why should I then care, though the
tempest may blow, If Jesus walks close

All to Jesus I surrender, make me,

All to Jesus I surrender, Lord, I give

I’m invited to come home to that city,
For the Word says, “Whosoever will,”

Death will never molest me in that city,
Never leave me lying cold and chill;
And I’ll enter to live up there forever
When I reach that city on the hill.

Then He’ll say unto me, “Well done,”

Farther along we’ll know all about
it.
Farther along we’ll understand
why;
Cheer up, my brother, live in the

We’ll understand it all by and by.

When death has come and taken our
loved ones, It leaves our home so
lonely and drear; Then do we wonder
why others prosper, Living so wicked
year after year.

Faithful till death said our loving
Master, A few more days to labor and
wait’ Toils of the road will then seem
as nothing, As we sweep through the
beautiful gate.

When we see Jesus coming in glory,
When He comes from His home in the

bright mansion, We’ll understand it all
by and by.</cantique>

I am resolved to follow the Saviour,
Faithful and true each day; Heed what

I am resolved to enter the kingdom,
Leaving the paths of sin; Friends may

Taught by the Bible, led by the Spirit,

He who was the friend of sinners,
Seeks thee, lost one, now; Sinner,
come, and at His footstool Penitently
bow. He who said, “I’ll not condemn
thee, Go and sin no more;” Speaks to
thee that word of pardon, As in days
of yore.

Oft on earth He healed the suff’rer By
His mighty hand; Still our sicknesses
and sorrows Go at His command. He
who gave His healing virtue, To a
woman’s touch; To the faith that
claims His fullness, Still will give as
much.

He who pardoned erring Peter, Never
need’st thou fear; He that came to
faithless Thomas, All thy doubt will
clear. He who let the loved disciple
On His bosom rest, Bids thee still,
with love as tender, Lean upon His
breast.

He who ‘mid the raging billows,
Walked upon the sea; Still can hush
our wildest tempest, As on Galilee.
He who wept and prayed in anguish,
In Gethsemane, Drinks with us each
cup of trembling, In our agony.

As of old He walked to Emmaus,
With them to abide; So through all
life’s way He walketh, Ever near our
side. Soon again we shall behold Him,
Hasten, Lord, the day! But ‘twill still be
“this same Jesus,” As He went away.</cantique>

>The first one to die for this Holy
Ghost plan, Was John the Baptist, but
he died like a man; Then cam the Lord
Jesus, they crucified Him, He taught
that the Spirit would save men from
sin.

CHORUS
It’s dripping with blood, yes, it’s
dripping with blood.
This Holy Ghost Gospel is
dripping with blood.
The blood of disciples who died
for the Truth,
This Holy Ghost Gospel is dripping
with blood.

There was Peter and Paul, and John
the divine, They gave up their lives so
this Gospel could shine; They mingled
their blood, like the prophets of old,
So the true Word of God could honest
be told.

Then they stoned Stephen,   he
preached against sin, He made them
so angry, they dashed his head in; But
he died in the Spirit, and gave up the
ghost, And went to join others, in that
life-giving host.

There’s souls under the altar, crying,
“How Long?” For the Lord to punish
those who’ve done wrong; But there’s
going to be more who’ll give their life’s
blood For this Holy Ghost Gospel
and its crimson flood.</cantique>

Oh! Our Lord is coming back to

Yes, our Lord is coming back to

Satan will be bound a thousand

After Jesus shall come back to earth

Jesus’ coming back will be the answer

Yes, the ransomed of the Lord shall
come to Zion then with joy, And in all
His holy mountain nothing hurts or

in every heart, and love without alloy,
After Jesus shall come back to earth

Then the sin and sorrow, pain and
death of this dark world shall cease, In

When Jesus comes the tempter’s
pow’r is broken;
When Jesus comes the tears are
wiped away.
He takes the gloom and fills the
life with glory,
For all is changed when Jesus
comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil spirits
drove him, Among the tombs he
dwelt in misery; He cut himself as
demon pow’rs possessed him. Then
Jesus came and set the captive free.

Unclean! Unclean! The leper cried in
torment,  The deaf, the dumb, in
helplessness stood near; The fever
raged, disease had gripped its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast out every
fear.

So men today have found the Saviour
able, They could not conquer passion,
lust and sin; Their broken hearts had
left them sad and lonely, Then Jesus
came and dwelt Himself within.</cantique>

Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, my God;
All the vain things that charm me
most, I sacrifice them to His blood.

See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

Were the whole realm of nature mine,
That were a present far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine, Demands
my soul, my life, my all!</cantique>

In that country over there?”

CHORUS
It will be light in the evening

The evening Light has come,
It is a fact that God and Christ are

So God’s servants come to tell you Of
a Bridegroom in the sky, Looking for
a holy people To be His bride soon,
by and by; He sends to us refreshing
water In this wondrous latter day;
They who really will be raptured Must
go thru the water way.

Are you on your way to ruin,
Cumbered with a load of care? See the
quick work God is doing That so His
glory you may share, At last the faith
He once delivered To the saints, is
ours today; To get in the Church
triumphant You must go the water

Have you looked and often wondered
Why the power is slack today? Will
you stay in that back number And go

For He’s done so very much for

The publican went to pray in the

Lord, be merciful to me!” He was
forgiven of every sin, and a deep peace
placed within; He said, “Come see this
Man from Galilee.”

The lame was made to walk, the dumb
was made to talk, That power was
spoken with love upon the sea; The
blind was made to see, I know it could
only be The mercy of that Man from
Galilee.

Nicodemus came by night, to know
the way of right, He asked the Son of
man what must he do. These words
He said to him, “Ye must be born
again,” By the Spirit of that Man from
Galilee.

The woman at the well, He all her sins

‘Neath the shade of the ever green

its foundation walls all so precious,
Where from gladness of heart I shall
shout! O no sights ever witnessed by

up there I shall spend my vacation
with Jesus, In the place He went on to
prepare.

There the weather will always be
perfect. Not a cloud shall sweep over
the sky;  and no earthquakes or
cyclones shall threaten, In the land of
the “Sweet by and by”; Soon there’s
going to be an excursion, I am booked
for a ride in the air. You’re invited to
share my vacation, And the feast with
our Bridegroom to share.

Here on earth when we take our
vacation, We return to our homes by

heaven, In those mansions of gold in
the sky. I shall dwell with my Savior
forever,   With Him sit on His
Heavenly Throne; All the days will be
one, long vacation, When my Savior

When the bugle call sinks into silence

When death came, was left far behind.
The angel that opened the records,
Not a trace of his greatness could find.

The widow was there with the

the drunkard, And the man that had
sold them the drink, With the people
who gave him the license, Together in
hell they did sink.

The moral man came to the judgment,
But his self-righteous rags would not
do; The men who had crucified Jesus

The soul that had put off salvation,

No heartaches are known in that city,
No tears ever moisten the eye, There’s
no disappointment in heaven, No
envy and strife in the sky; The saints

sweet harmony there; My heart is now
set on that city, And some day its
blessings I’ll share.

My loved ones are gathering yonder,
My friends, too, are passing away; And
soon I shall join their bright number,
And dwell in eternity’s day; They’re

gathered To hear what the Shepherd
would say, His voice like the sound of
slow waters, Came rippling through
vessels of clay.

‘Tis the voice that brought forth
creation And set all the stars in array,
And speaks words of Life and of
wisdom, In the midst of His people
today.

Through prophets, by precious blood
purchased, Cleansed and surrendered

Are you washed in the blood,
In the soul-cleansing blood of the

Are your garments spotless? Are

Are you washed in the blood of the
Lamb?

Are you walking daily by the Savior’s

the Lamb? Do you rest each moment
in the Crucified? Are you washed in
the blood of the Lamb?

When the Bridegroom cometh, will
your robes be white, Pure and white in
the blood of the Lamb? Will your soul
be ready for the mansions bright And
be washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Lay aside the garments that are stained

CHORUS
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
Yes, Jesus loves me,
The Bible tells me so.

Jesus loves me!   He who died,
Heaven’s gates to open wide; He will

Jesus loves me!   Loves me still,
Though I’m very weak and ill; From

CHORUS
Are you in the Church

Are you in the Saviour’s Bride?
Come and be baptized into the
Body,
And forevermore abide.

There is but one Church, Bride or
Body, And into it we’re all baptized;
By the one, true, promised Holy Spirit;
Though by the world we’re all
despised.

Every creed has claimed to be the
Body, But the “plumb line” proved
untrue All their dreams, for God has
so determined To bring His Son’s true
Bride to view.

Many thought that they were in the
Body, ‘Till the Holy Ghost had come;
When the Word of God was opened
to them, They entered in, and yet
there’s room.

Those who died before the Holy Spirit
Came upon us from on high, May, by
faith with Saints of old departed, Arise
to meet Him in the sky.

When the Bridegroom comes, will you
be ready; And your vessel all filled and
bright? You will be among the foolish
virgins If you do not walk in the light.</cantique>

Yes, this is like Heaven to me;
I’ve crossed over Jordan to

Mercy is calling you, won’t you give

A wonderful time is just ahead, Our

When He reached down His hand

I was lost and undone, without
God or His Son,
When He reached down His hand

I was nearing despair, when He came

I could be free; Then He lifted my
feet, gave me glory complete, When
He reached down His hand for me, for

How my heart doth rejoice since I
made Him my choice, From the
tempest to Him now I flee; Now I
lean on His arm I’m secure from all

Since the Lord gave me peace,
heavenly joys never cease; Lord, I give

And when I think that God, His Son

When darkness seems to hide His face,

Support me in the whelming flood;

Be filled with the Spirit, your

Heaven’s powers are shaking, and

be of the sky; God’s Church is the

Let us then be true and faithful,
Trusting, serving, every day; Just one

CHORUS
Lift Him up, lift Him up,
Still He speaks from eternity,
“And I, if I be lifted up from the

Will draw all men unto me.”

O the world is hungry for the living

Don’t exalt the preacher, don’t exalt
the pew, Preach the Gospel simple,
full and free; Prove Him and you will
find that promise is true, “I’ll draw all

Lift Him up by living as a Christian
ought, Let the world in you the

follow Him who once taught, “I’ll

>O land of rest, for thee I sigh! When
will the moment come When I shall
lay my armor by, And dwell in peace
at home?

CHORUS
We’ll work till Jesus comes,
We’ll work till Jesus comes,
We’ll work till Jesus comes,
And we’ll be gathered home!

To Jesus Christ I fled for rest; He bade
me cease to roam; And lean for succor
on His breast Till He conduct me
home?

I sought at once my Saviour’s side, No
more my steps shall roam; With Him
I’ll brave death’s chilling tide And
reach my heavenly home.</cantique>

>The windows of Heaven are open,
The blessings are falling tonight,
There’s joy, joy, joy in my heart, For
Jesus makes everything right; I gave
Him my old tattered garment, He gave
me a robe of pure white, I’m feasting
today on the Manna, And that’s why
I’m happy tonight.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="PRECIOUS MEMORIES" numero="215" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>Precious memories, unseen angels,
Sent from somewhere to my soul;
How they linger, ever near me, And
the sacred past unfold.

CHORUS
Precious memories, how they
linger,
How they ever flood my soul;
In the stillness of the midnight,
Precious, sacred scenes unfold.

Precious father, loving mother, Fly
across the lonely years; And old home
scenes of my childhood, In fond
memory appear.

In the stillness of the midnight,
Echoes from the past I hear; Old-time
singing, gladness bringing, From that
lovely land somewhere.

As I travel on life’s pathway, Know
not what the years may hold; As I
ponder, hope grows fonder, Precious
memories flood my soul.

Precious memories of the prophet,
Flood my soul from day to day, I
remember scenes so precious That can
never pass away.

I’ve heard the Message and Its signal
That day’s end is near at hand, But I
remember that He promised He’d
return for those who’d stand.

Precious memories, glorious meetings
Across this land from sea to sea
Where I heard the prophet’s Message
That brought Life and hope to me.

Precious memories in this storehouse
Where the Food was laid away, We’ve
returned to where he stored It,
Spiritual Food against this day.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="THE END TIME" numero="216" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>I look and see earth’s sorrowing
picture, The hoarding mobs for selfish
gain; Their toil of hand for ease and
comfort, Can they not see, their doom
is sealed, it’s all in vain.

CHORUS
The end is here, it’s now at hand,
The Bride is gathering; the world
is failing;
Israel’s awak’ning; nations are
breaking’
Our prophet taught us, we believe
the end is here.

Sirs, this is the time! Our prophet
spoke of, The Angel came with a
Shout, The mountain shook as His
Voice cried out, “Time is no more.”
Loud and clear the Shout went forth.

Have you considered the end-time
Message? Have you considered
Malachi 4? Revelation 10:7 and St.
Luke 17 Proclaims this Message now,
and then forevermore.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="IT IS NO SECRET" numero="217" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>It is no secret what God can do; What
He’s done for others, He’ll do for you.
With arms wide open, He’ll pardon
you, It is no secret what God can do.

It is no secret, I believe the Word; My
eyes were opened, my heart was stirred.
I recognized him the first I heard The
prophet bring us the SPOKEN
WORD.

It is no secret where I have been; I
met the prophet and he took me in.
With my heart wide open, the Light
shone in. It is no secret I follow him.

It is no secret of who he is, More than
a prophet, I’m convinced of this: The
seventh angel, the son of man, The
Elijah promised in God’s great plan.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD!" numero="218" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>When I consider the works of my
God, The moon and the stars, the
path that He trod. The sheep and the
oxen, the beast of the field, All of
these wonders make me know that
He’s real.

CHORUS
How great is our God! How great
is His Word!
He’s the greatest one that ever
was heard.
He rolled back the waters of the
mighty Red Sea.
And He said, “I will lead you.
Put your trust in Me.”

He used our prophet in many a way
To show forth His greatness in this our
day. He never changes; He’s always
the same, So worship and praise Him
and love His dear Name.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="SO JUST BE FAITHFUL" numero="219" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>In these days of trials so near the end,
When Christ from Glory doth now
descend, Men’s hearts are failing and
filled with fear, We know the end time
is surely here.

CHORUS
So just be faithful, believe His
Word;
Stay with the Message that you
have heard;
List’ to His prophet, his Message
heed;
Walk in the Light where His star
doth lead.

In every church age a star did shine,
To help God’s people a Truth to find;
In this last church age a star shines
bright, So friend receive It, walk in the
Light.

Do not be fearful or filled with dread,
Your prophet sleepeth, he is not dead;
The Bride is waiting now for that
Voice, And in this hope we can now
rejoice.

His Word of promise he gave the
Bride, From his White Charger the
prophet cried, “Yet one more time
shall I ride this trail” THUS SAITH
THE LORD can never fail.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="BLEST BE THE TIE THAT BINDS" numero="220" auteur="" reference="" gamme=""

>Blest be the tie that binds Our hearts
in Christian love; The fellowship of
kindred minds Is like to that above.

Before our Father’s throne, We pour
our ardent prayers; Our fears, our
hopes, our aims are one, Our
comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes, Our
mutual burdens bear; And often for
each other flows The sympathizing
tear.

When we asunder part, It gives us
inward pain; But we shall still be
joined in heart, And hope to meet
again.</cantique>

Till we meet! Till we meet” Till
we meet at Jesus’ feet; Till we

you till we meet again!


God be with you till we meet again!
‘Neath His wings securely hide you,
Daily manna still provide you; God be

God be with you till we meet again!
When life’s perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you;
God be with you till we meet again!

God be with you till we meet again!
Keep love’s banner floating o’er you,
Smite death’s threat’ning wave before
you; God be with you till we meet
again!</cantique>

>Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and o f woe; It will
joy and comfort give you, Take it,

CHORUS
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of Heaven;
Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of Heaven.

Take the name of Jesus ever, As a
shield from every snare; If temptations
round you gather, Breathe that holy
name in prayer.

O the precious name of Jesus! How it
thrills our souls with joy, When His
loving arms receive us, And His songs
our tongues employ!

At the name of Jesus bowing, Falling
prostrate at His feet, King of kings in
Heaven we’ll crown Him, When our
journey is complete.</cantique>
