	<cantique titre="PRAISE MY SOUL, THE" numero="1" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>1. Praise, my soul, the King of heaven ;
To His feet thy tribute bring ;
Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven,
Who like thee His praise shall sing ?
Praise Him ! praise Him !
Praise the everlasting King !
    
2. Praise Him for His grace and favour
To our fathers in distress ;
Praise Him, still the same as ever,
Slow to chide, and swift to bless :
Praise Him ! praise Him !
Glorious in His faithfulness !
    
3. Father- like He tends and spares us,
Well our feeble frame He knows ;
In His hands He gently bears us,
Rescues us from all our foes :
Praise Him ! praise Him !
Widely as His mercy flows.
    
4. Angels, help us to adore Him,
Ye behold Him face to face !
Sun and moon, bow down before Him !
Dwellers all in time and space,
Praise Him ! praise Him !
Praise with us the God of grace !</cantique>
	<cantique titre="A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR" numero="2" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>1. A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing :
Our Helper He, amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work his woe ;
His craft and power are great,
And armed with cruel hate —
On earth is not his equal.
    
2. Did we in our own strength confide,
Our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be ?
Christ Jesus, it is He !
Lord Sabaoth is His name,
From age to age the same :
And He must win the battle.
    
3. And though this world, with devils
filled,
Should threaten to undo us:
We will not fear; for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us.
Let goods and kindred go,
This mortal life also ;
The body they may kill :
God's truth abideth still,
His Kingdom is for ever.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="A SAFE STRONGHOLD" numero="3" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>1. A safe stronghold our God is still,
A trusty shield and weapon ;
He'll help us clear from all the ill
That hath us now o'ertaken.
The ancient prince of hell
Hath risen with purpose fell ;
Strong mail of craft and power
He weareth in this hour,
On earth is not his fellow.
    
2. With force of arms we nothing can,
Full soon were we down-ridden ;
But for us fights the proper Man,
Whom God Himself hath bidden.
Ask ye, Who is this same ?
Christ Jesus is His name,
The Lord Sabaoth's Son ;
He, and no other one,
Shall conquer in the battle.
    
3. And were this world all devils o'er,
And watching to devour us,
We lay it not to heart so sore ;
Not they can overpower us.
And let the prince of ill
Look grim as e'er he will,
He harms us not a whit :
For why ? His doom is writ ;
A word shall quickly slay him.
    
4. God's word, for all their craft and force,
One moment will not linger,
But, spite of hell, shall have its course;
'Tis written by His finger.
And though they take our life,
Goods, honour, children, wife,
Yet is their profit small ;
These things shall vanish all,
The citv of God remaineth.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="THE GOD OF ABRAHAM" numero="4" auteur="" reference="" gamme=""

Who reigns enthroned above,
Ancient of everlasting days,
And God of love !
Jehovah, great I AM !
By earth and Heaven confest !
I bow, and bless the sacred name,
For ever blest !
    
2. The God of Abraham praise !
At whose supreme command
From earth I rise, and seek the joys
At His right hand :
I all on earth forsake,
Its wisdom, fame, and power,
And Him my only portion make,
My Shield and Tower.
    
3. The God of Abraham praise !
Whose all-sufficient grace
Shall guide me all my happy days
In all my ways :
He calls a worm His friend !
He calls Himself my God !
And He shall save me to the end
Through Jesus' blood !
    
4. He by Himself hath sworn,
I on His oath depend ;
I shall, on eagles' wings upborne,
To heaven ascend :
I shall behold His face,
I shall His power adore,
And sing the wonders of His grace
For evermore !
    
5. The whole triumphant host
Give thanks to God on high :
" Hail ! Father, Son, and Holy Ghost !
They ever cry :
Hail ! Abraham's God and mine !
I join the heavenly lays;
All might and majesty are Thine,
And endless praise !</cantique>

Chaos and darkness heard,
And took their flight,

And, where the Gospel day
Sheds not its glorious ray,

On Thy redeeming wing,
Healing and sight —
Health to the sick in mind,
Sight to the inly blind —
Oh, now to all mankind
" Let there be light ! "
    
3. Spirit of truth and love,
Life-giving, holy Dove,
Speed forth Thy flight !
Move on the waters' face
By Thine almighty grace,
And in earth's darkest place
" Let there be light ! "

Boundless as ocean's tidQ
Rolling in fullest pride,

Gird on Thy mighty sword ;
Our prayer attend :

Cheerfully join in one,
Praising His name, —
Ye who have felt His blood
Sealing your peace with God,

" Worthy the Lamb ! "
    
3. Join, all ye ransomed race,
Our Lord and God to bless ;
Praise ye His name !
In Him we will rejoice,
And make a joyful noise,

And without ceasing sing,

This is all my plea-

And Jesus died for me.
    
2. 'Twas grace that wrote my name
In life's eternal book ;
'Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,
Who all my sorrows took.
    
3. Grace taught my wandering feet
To tread the heavenly road ;
And new supplies each hour I meet,
While pressing on to God.

And made mine eyes o'erflow ;
'Twas grace which kept me to this day,
And will not let me go.

Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice:
Him serve with mirth, His praise forth tell,
Come ye before Him and rejoice.

Without our aid He did us make :
We are His flock. He doth us feed,
And for His sheep He doth us take.
    
3. Oh, enter then His gates with praise,
Approach with joy His courts unto :
Praise, laud, and bless His name always,
For it is seemly so to do.

His mercy is for ever sure ;
His truth at all times firmly stood,
And shall from age to age endure.</cantique>

Oh to learn this lesson well !
Still by constant mercy fed,

Daily strength for daily needs;
Cast foreboding fear away,
Take the manna of to-day.

Our Shield and Defender,
The Ancient of Days,
Pavilioned in splendour,
And girded with praise.
    
2. Oh, tell of His might,
Oh, sing of His grace !
Whose robe is the light,
Whose canopy space ;
His chariots of wrath
The deep thunder-clouds form,
And dark is His path
On the wings of the storm.
    
3. The earth with its store
Of wonders untold,
Almighty ! Thy power
Hath founded of old :
Hath 'stablished it fast
By a changeless decree ;
And round it hath cast,
Like a mantle, the sea.
    
4. Thy bountiful care,
What tongue can recite ?
It breathes in the air,
It shines in the light ;
It streams from the hills,
It descends to the plain,
And sweetly distils in
The dew and the rain.
    
5. Frail children of dust,
And feeble as frail —
In Thee do we trust,
Nor find Thee to fail :
Thy mercies how tender,
How firm to the end !
Our Maker, Defender,
Redeemer, and Friend !
    
6. O measureless Might !
Ineffable Love !
While angels delight
To hymn Thee above,
The humbler creation,
Though feeble their lays,
With true adoration
Shall sing to Thy praise.</cantique>

His grace evermore.

Ye sheep of His fold,
What terror can harm
With Him to uphold ?
His saints are His treasure,
Their peace will He seek,
And pour without measure
His gifts on the meek.
    
3. Go on in His might,
Ye men of the Lord :
His word be your light,
His promise your sword :
The King of Salvation
Your foes will subdue,
Bring forth your oblation,
Your praises renew.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="THOUGH TROUBLES ASSAIL" numero="13" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>1. Though troubles assail,
And dangers affright ;
Though friends should all fail,
And foes all unite —
Yet one thing secures us,
Whatever betide :
The Scripture assures us,
" The Lord will provide."
    
2. The birds, without barn
Or storehouse, are fed ;
From them let us learn
To trust for our bread :
His saints what is fitting
Shall ne'er be denied,
So long as 'tis written,
" The Lord will provide.'*
    
3. His call we obey.
Like Abram of old,
Not knowing our way ;
But faith makes us bold :
For though we are strangers,
We have a good Guide ;
And trust in ail dangers :
" The Lord will provide."
    
4. No strength of our own,
Or goodness we claim ;
Yet since we have known
The Saviour's great name,
In this our strong tower
For safety we hide,
Almighty His power :
" The Lord will provide.'</cantique>
	<cantique titre="BEGONE, UNBELIEF !" numero="14" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>1. Begone, unbelief,
My Saviour is near,
And for my relief
Will surely appear :
By prayer let me wrestle,
And He will perform ;
With Christ in the vessel,
I smile at the storm.
    
2. Though dark be my way,
Since He is my Guide,
'Tis mine to obey,
Tis His to provide :
Though cisterns be broken,
And creatures all fail,
The word He hath spoken
Shall surely prevail.
    
3. His love, in time past,
Forbids me to think
He'll leave me at last
In trouble to sink :
Each sweet Ebenezer
I have in review
Confirms His good pleasure
To help me quite through.
    
4. Why should I complain
Of want or distress,
Temptation or pain ? —
He told me no less ;
The heirs of salvation,
I know from His Word,
Through much tribulation
Must follow their Lord.
    
5. How bitter that cup
No heart can conceive,
Which He drank quite up,
That sinners might live !
His way was much rougher
And darker than mine ;
Did Christ, my Lord, suffer,
And shall I repine ?
    
6. Since all that I meet
Shall work for my good,
The bitter is sweet,
The medicine, food ;
Though painful at present,
'Twill cease before long,
And then — oh, how pleasant
The conqueror's song !</cantique>

The love that gave Jesus to die !
Praise God, it is mine, this love so divine, —
The love that gave Jesus to die !
    
2. Oh, how great was the love that was shown
To us ! — we can never tell why —
Not to angels, but men; let us praise Him again,
For the love that gave Jesus to die!
    
3. Now this love unto all God commends,
Not one would His mercy pass by ;
" Whosoever shall call," there is
pardon for all
In the love that gave Jesus to die !
    
4. Who is he that can separate those
Whom God doth in love justify ?
Whatsoever we need He includes in the deed
In the love that gave Jesus to die !</cantique>
	<cantique titre="REDEMPTION, OH" numero="16" auteur="" reference="" gamme=""

Glad message for you and for me :
That Jesus has purchased our pardon,
And paid all the debt on the tree.

Receive the glad message — 'tis true;
Trust now in the crucified Saviour :
Salvation He offers to you.

And made us by grace sons of God ;
A fountain is opened for sinners :
Oh, wash and be cleansed in the
blood !

Though present to tempt and annoy ;
For Christ, in His blessed redemption,
The power of sin shall destroy.

To Jesus, oh hasten to-day ;
For He will receive him that cometh,
And never will turn him away.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="GOD LOVED THE WORLD" numero="17" auteur="" reference="" gamme=""

And ruined by the Fall ;
Salvation full, at highest cost*
He offers free to all.
    
CHORUS
"Oh, 'twas love, 'twas wondrous love,
The love of God to me !
It brought my Saviour from above,
To die on Calvary.
    
2. E'en now by faith I claim Him mine,
The risen Son of God ;
Redemption by His death I find,
And cleansing through the Blood.
    
3. Love brings the glorious fulness in,
And to His saints makes known
The blessed rest from inbred sin,
Through faith in Christ alone.
    
4. Believing souls, rejoicing go ;
There shall to you be given
A glorious foretaste, here below,
Of endless life in heaven.
    
5. Of victory now o'er Satan's power
Let all the ransomed sing,
And triumph in the dying hour,
Through Christ the Lord, our King.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="IN GRACE THE HOLY GOD" numero="18" auteur="" reference="" gamme=""

Did full salvation plan,
Electing in His sovereign grace
To save rebellious man.

Through faith, . . . through faith, . . .

Not of works, lest any man should boast :
It is the gift of God.
It is the gift of God ; it is the gift of God ;
It is the gift of God — the gift of God.
    
2. This grace of God appears
In Jesus Christ His Son,
He, lifted on the cross of shame,
The grace of God makes known.
    
3. To all who do believe
In God, through Christ revealed,
By grace they full salvation have,
And " sons of God " are sealed.</cantique>
	<cantique titre="IN SOME WAY OR OTHER" numero="19" auteur="" reference="" gamme=""

>1. In some way or other
The Lord will provide:
It may not be my way,
It may not be thy way ;
And yet, in His own way,
" The Lord will provide."
    
CHORUS
"Then we'll trust in the Lord,
And He will provide :
Yes, we'll trust in the Lord,
And He will provide.
    
2. At some time or other
The Lord will provide :
It may not be my time,
It may not be thy time ;
And yet, in His own time,
" The Lord will provide.'
    
3. Despond then no longer ;
The Lord will provide ;
And this be the token —
No word He hath spoken
Was ever yet broken :
" The Lord will provide.'

With shoutings victorious,
We'll join in the chorus,

Redemption ground, oh, wondrous grace
Here let our praise to God abound,
Who saves us on redemption ground !

And with His holy will made war ;
But now my songs to God abound ;
I'm standing on redemption ground.
    
3. Oh, joyous hour when God to me
A vision gave of Calvary ;
My bonds were loosed, my soul un- bound:
I sang upon redemption ground.
    
4. No works of merit now I plead,
But Jesus take for all my need ;
No righteousness in me is found,
Except upon redemption ground.

Accept redemption, and be blest :
The Christ who died, by God is crowned
To pardon on redemption ground.</cantique>

By " precious blood " made nigh,
Accepted in the " Well-beloved,"
Near to God's heart we lie.

It doth not yet appear;
But when our precious Lord we see,

To enrich the humble poor.

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by ;
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light ;

While mortals sleep, the angels keep
Their watch of wondering love.
O morning stars, together
Proclaim the holy birth,
And praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth !

The wondrous gift is given !
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His heaven.
No ear may hear His coming ;
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him, still
The dear Christ enters in.
    
4. O holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend to us, we pray ;
Cast out our sin and enter in —

Tears and smiles like us He knew ;

And He shareth in our gladness.

Music of all melodies.

Stream of life from out God's throne,

Sacred blood for sinners spilt —

Which from my Saviour flowed !
And still in heaven my song shall be,
" The precious, precious blood! "
    
2. " I will remember now no more " —
God's faithful Word has said —
" The follies and the sins of him
For whom My Son has bled."
    
3. Not all my well-remembered sins
Can startle or dismay :
That precious blood atones for all,
And bears my guilt away.
    
4. Perhaps this feeble frame of mine
Will soon in sickness lie ;
But, resting on that precious blood,
How peacefully I'll die !</cantique>

>1. Beneath the Cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand —
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land ;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noontide heat,
And the burden of the day.
    
2. O safe and happy shelter,
O refuge tried and sweet,
O trysting place, where Heaven's love
And Heaven's justice meet !
As to the holy patriarch
That wondrous dream was given,
So seems my Saviour's cross to me
A ladder up to heaven.
    
3. There lies beneath its shadow,
But on the farther side,
The darkness of an awful grave
That gapes both deep and wide ;
And there between us stands the cross,
Two arms outstretched to save,
Like a watchman set to guard the way
From that eternal grave.
    
4. Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eye at times can see
The very dying form of One
Who suffered there for me ;
And from my smitten heart, with tears,
Two wonders I confess —
The wonder of His glorious love,
And my own worthlessness.
    
5. I take, O cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place ;
T ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face :
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss —
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross.</cantique>

Your ransom and peace,
Your surety He is,
Come, see if there ever
Was sorrow like His.
    
2. For what you have done
His blood must atone:
The Father hath punished
For you His dear Son :
The Lord, in the day
Of His anger did lay
Your sins on the Lamb,
And He bore them away.
    
3. He died to atone
For sins not His own ;
Your debt He hath paid
And your work He hath done :
Ye all may receive
The peace He did leave,
Who made intercession,
" My Father, forgive ! "
    
4. For you and for me
He prayed on the tree ;
The prayer is accepted,
The sinner is free ;
The sinner am I,
Who on Jesus rely,
And come for the pardon
God cannot deny.
    
5. His death is my plea ;
My Advocate see,
And hear the blood speak
That hath answered for me:
He purchased the grace
Which now I embrace ;
O Father, Thou know'st
He hath died in my place !</cantique>

The King of kings, and Lord of lords,
He reigns in perfect light.
    
3. The joy of all who dwell above,
The joy of all below,
To whom He manifests His love,
And grants His name to know.
    
4. To them the cross, with all its shame,
With all its grace, is given :
Their name, an everlasting name ;
Their joy, the joy of heaven.
    
5. They suffer with their Lord below,
They reign with Him above;
Their profit and their bliss to know

2. When He, from His lofty throne,
Stooped to do and die.
Everything was fully done :
Hearken to His cry.
    
3. Weary, working, burdened one,
Wherefore toil you so ?
Cease your doing ; all was done

Once for all, O brother, believe it :

Upon the Lamb was laid ;

The angels by His favour stand
Before the throne of glory :
Swiftly they fly at His command,
To guard His own of every land.

Our weak heart clings,
Hast given us joys, tender and true,
Yet all with wings,

Though amply blest,
Can never find, although they seek,
A perfect rest —
Nor ever shall, until they lean
On Jesus' breast.</cantique>

2. Come, bless the Lord, whose love

So sweet a rest to wearied minds,
Provides an antepast of heaven,
And gives this day the food of seven.
    
3. Oh that our thoughts and thanks may

As grateful incense to the skies,
And draw from heaven that sweet

Is the dear pledge of glorious rest,
Which for the Church of God remains ;
The end of cares, the end of pains.

In holy pleasures, pass away :
How sweet a Sabbath thus to spend,
In hope of one that ne'er shall end!</cantique>

Enter on their rest above —
Seems the earth so poor and vast ? —
All our life-joy overcast ?
Hush ! be every murmur dumb :
It is only " Till He come I "

Would we have one sorrow less ?
All the sharpness of the cross,
All that tells the world is loss —
Death, and darkness, and the tomb —
Only whisper " Till He come ! "

Drink the wine and break the bread —
Sweet memorials — till the Lord
Call us round His heavenly board ;

What are the joys that cause ere long
Eternal bursts of praise ?
    
3. To look within and see no stain,
Abroad no curse to trace ;
To shed no tears, to feel no pain,
But see Thee face to face.

The image of our Lord.</cantique>

Alone with Me and with My Father here,

I know how hardly souls are wooed

My choicest wreaths are always wet with tears.
    
4. Come ye and rest : the journey is too
great,
And ye will faint beside the way, and sink:
The bread of life is here for you to eat,
And here for you the wine of love to drink.
    
5. Then, fresh from converse with your

And work till daylight softens into even:
The brief hours are not lost in which ye learn

Safe in the glory for evermore :

Who follows in their train ?

The matron and the maid —
Around the Saviour's throne rejoice,
In robes of light arrayed,
They climbed the steep ascent of heaven
Through peril, toil, and pain :

To follow in their train.</cantique>

>1. Sometimes a light surprises
The Christian while he sings ;
It is the Lord who rises
With healing in His wings.
When comforts are declining,
He grants the soul again
A season of clear shining,
To cheer it after rain.
    
2. In holy contemplation,
We sweetly then pursue
The theme of God's salvation,
And find it ever new ;
Set free from present sorrow,
We cheerfully can say —
E'en let th' unknown to-morrow
Bring with it what it may :
    
3. It can bring with it nothing
But He will bear us through ;
Who gives the lilies clothing,
Will clothe His people too :
Beneath the spreading heavens
No creature but is fed ;
And He who feeds the ravens
Will give His children bread.
    
4. Though vine nor fig tree neither
Their wonted fruit should bear ;
Though all the fields should wither,
Nor flocks nor herds be there :
Yet God the same abiding,
His praise shall tune my voice ;
For, while in Him confiding,
I cannot but rejoice.</cantique>

The Rock where in safety My own shall abide;
I'll never forsake thee — My Word hath declared it;

2. When chilled by the waves that are surging around me,
And clouds of affliction like billows may roll,
I'll cling to His word, which can never be broken,
And joy in the comfrot it brings to my soul.
    
3. Though tried in the furnace, my faith shall not falter,
But, trusting in Jesus, the cross I will bear;
And hoping, enduring, believing, obeying,
I'll cling to His promise, and rest in His care.</cantique>

And darkness seemed to hide the toilsome road :
Amazed, again I cried, " Thy way, O God? "

It shall serve thee to the end.
Love divine will fill thy storehouse,
Or thy handful still renew ;

Make a royal feast for two.
    
2. For the heart grows rich in giving :
All its wealth is living grain ;
Seeds — which mildew in the garner—
Scattered, fill with gold the plain.

Do thy steps drag wearily ?
Help to lift thy brother's burden —
God will bear both it and thee.
    
3. Lost and weary on the mountains,
Wouldst thou sleep amidst the snow?
Chafe that frozen form beside thee,
And together both shall glow.
Art thou wounded in life's battle ?
Many stricken round thee moan;
Give to them thy precious ointment,
And that balm shall heal thine own.
    
4. Is thy heart a well left empty?
None but God its void can fill ;
Nothing but a ceaseless fountain
Can its ceaseless longings still.
Is thy heart a living power ?
Self-entwined, its strength sinks low;
It can only live by loving,
And by serving love will grow.</cantique>

2. Thrust in your sharpened sickle,

The night is fast approaching,
And soon will come again.
The Master calls for reapers,
And shall He call in vain ?
Shall sheaves lie there ungathered,
And waste upon the plain ?

Points to the noon below ;
And come with the strong sinew,
Nor fainl in heat or cold ;

Draws round its wealth of gold.

Keep back no words of knowledge

Gone through death to glory bright,
Present with the Lord in light ;

More must yet be gathered in.
    
3. Some have drifted far from God,
Trampling on the Saviour's blood,
By the worldling's glitter caught,
Selling life and soul for naught :
Fashion's form for every hour,
Christian name without the power ;
Dead in trespasses and sin —
Oh, that they were gathered in !
    
4. Some are sunk in vice and shame,
Heedless of the Saviour's name ;
Some, in superstition's sway,
Hate the light of Gospel-day :
Thou thy testimony give —
They may yet believe and live ;
For, from 'mong the ranks of sin,
More must yet be gathered in !</cantique>

>1. There's a wonderful story I've heard long ago,
'Tis called " The sweet story of old";
I hear it so often, wherever I go
That same old story is told ;
And I've thought it was strange that
so often they'd tell
That story as if it were new ;
But I've found out the reason they
loved it so well —
That old, old story is true !
    
CHORUS
"That old, old story is true,
That old, old story is true ;
But I've found out the reason they loved it so well -
That old, old story is true !
    
2. They told of a Saviour so lovely and pure,
That came to the earth to dwell,
To seek for His lost ones, and make
them secure
From death and the power of hell ;
That He was despised, and with
thorns He was crowned,
On the cross was extended to view ;
But oh, what sweet peace in my heart
since I've found
That old, old story is true !
    
CHORUS
"But oh, what sweet peace in my heart since T've found
That old, old story is true !
    
3. He arose and ascended to heaven, we're told,
Triumphant o'er death and hell ;
He's preparing a place in that city of gold,
Where loved ones for ever may dwell;
Where our kindred we'll meet, and
we'll nevermore part ;
And oh, while I tell it to you,
It is peace to my soul, it is joy to my
heart —
That old, old story is true !
    
CHORUS
"It is peace to my soul, it is joy to my heart-
That old, old story is true !
    
4. Oh, that wonderful story I love to repeat,
Of peace and goodwill to men ;
There's no story to me that is half so sweet,
As I hear it again and again.
He invites you to come — He will you,freely receive,
And this message He sendeth to
" There's a mansion in glory for all who believe,"
That old, old story is true.

His truth, not mine, the tie.</cantique>

Its fountains, and its shade ;
A blessing in its fulness,

So near ! — yet out of sight.

	<cantique titre="OH FOR A SONG, A FAIR" numero="935" auteur="" reference="" gamme="" 
refrain=""
>1. Oh, for a song, a fair new song,
Of praise, and joy, and love !
To reach the hearts of earth's sad throng,
And lift to heaven above —
Of praise like the praise that the
angels bring ;
Of joy like the joy of the birds :
Of the love in our hearts for the
Christ our King —
Love ever too deep for words.
    
2. Oh, for a song, a fair new song,
That ne'er was sung before !
To sing to Him to whom belong
Our praises evermore —
A song like the echo from harps above,
Dropped down from the city of gold;
Yea, a song of the joy, and the praise, and love,
That ne'er hath been sung or told.
    
3. Oh, who shall sing this fair new song,
Or make its chords complete —
All notes of love, in souls that throng,
And place before His feet.
All fadeless the flowers in His path-
way strewn,
The pathway of Jesus our King ?
Help us, Lord ! for alas, sadly out of tune
Are the hearts which the song would sing.
    
4. Oh, help us, Lord ! who knowest all !
We cannot sing or speak ;
The clearest notes our lips let fall
Seem e'er too cold and weak :
Though sweet are the strains which
our songs have rung
From earth to the city of gold,
Yet His fulness of glory we never have sung—
The half ne'er hath yet been told.
    
5. Such songs as angels ne'er can bring,
The joy more pure than birds ;
The love we bear for Christ our King-
'Tis far too deep for words.
Be still, heart of mine ! we must wait a while,
Thy God will attune thee ere long ;
Then in heaven thou shalt sing in the
Master's smile
For ever the fair new song !</cantique>

And with sweetest rapture knowing,
And all the blest ones, who have gone
To the land of life and song,
We with shoutings shall rejoin,

Fierce the howling of the gale,
Long and dark the storm around our

But the Lord will guide the way
To the shining realms of day,
Where the storms of earth shall come

3. Though our eyes be filled with tears,

In His love to take us home,
And we'll never know a sorrow there.</cantique>

Centre of all, and the theme of their song -

>1. I saw a way-worn traveller,
In tattered garments clad,
And struggling up the mountain,
It seemed that he was sad ;
His back was laden heavy,
His strength was almost gone,
Yet he shouted as he journeyed,
" Deliverance will come !
    
CHORUS
Then palms of victory, crowns of glory
Palms of victory I shall bear."
    
2. The summer sun was shining,
The sweat was on his brow,
His garments worn and dusty,
His step seemed very slow ;
But he kept pressing onward,
For he was wending home,
Still shouting as he journeyed,
" Deliverance will come ! "
    
3. The songsters in the arbour
That stood beside the way
Attracted his attention,
Inviting his delay :
His watchword being " Onward ! "
He stopped his ears and ran,
Still shouting as he journeyed,
" Deliverance will come ! "
    
4. I saw him in the evening ;
The sun was bending low ;
He'd overtopped the mountain,
And reached the vale below :
He saw the Golden City —
His everlasting home, —
And shouted loud, " Hosanna !
Deliverance will come ! "
    
5. While gazing on that City,
Just o'er the narrow flood,
A band of holy angels
Came from the throne of God ;
They bore him on their pinions
Safe o'er the dashing foam,
And joined him in his triumph :
Deliverance had come !
    
6. I heard the song of triumph
They sang upon that shore,
Saying, " Jesus has redeemed us
To suffer nevermore ! "
Then, casting his eyes backward
On the race which he had run,
He shouted loud, " Hosanna !
Deliverance has come ! "</cantique>

Bearing the loved ones over the tide

Wait for the others coming some time ;
Safe with the angels, whiter than snow,
Watching for dear ones waiting below.

Looking for someone, beckoning, Come ;
Bright as a sunbeam, pure as the dew.
Anxiously looking, mother, for you.

In that beautiful place He is gone to prepare,
For all who are washed and forgiven ;
And many dear children are gathering there,
" For of such is the kingdom of heaven."

Now guide us, and send us the staff and light.</cantique>

And what is thy prospect to-day ?
Why toil for the wealth that will perish,
The treasures that rust and decay ?
Oh, think of thy soul, that for ever
Must live on eternity's shore;
When thou in the dust art forgotten,
When pleasure can charm thee no
more.

"'Twill profit thee nothing, but fearful the cost

In tones of compassion and love,
To feel that sweet rapture of pardon,
And lay up thy treasure above:
Oh, kneel at the cross where He suffered
To ransom thy soul from the grave ;
The arm of His mercy will hold thee,
The arm that is mighty to save.
    
3. As summer is waning, my brother,
Repent, ere the season is past;
God's goodness to thee is extended
As long as the daybeam shall last ;
Then slight not the warning repeated
With all the bright moments that roll ;
Nor say, when the harvest is ended,
That no one hath cared for thy soul.</cantique>

And drop like the happy sunlight down
Into the hearts of suffering men,
And teach them to look up again :

And into their blinded bosoms flash :
Then with their evil thoughts subdued,
I'd teach them Christian brotherhood :

Proclaiming peace on my world-wide way,
Bidding the saddened earth rejoice —
If I were a voice, an immortal voice,
I would fly, I would fly,
I would fly on the wings of day.</cantique>

Many a dear familiar spot
Brought within my recollection
Scenes I'd seemingly forgot;
There, the orchard — meadow, yonder —
Here, the deep, old-fashioned well,
With its old moss-covered bucket,
Sent a thrill no tongue can tell.
    
2. Though the house was held by strangers,
All remained the same within;
Just as when a child I rambled
Up and down, and out and in ;
To the garret dark ascending —
Once a source of childish dread —
Peering through the misty cobwebs,
Lo ! I saw my cradle bed.
    
3. Quick I drew it from the rubbish
Covered o'er with dust so long :
When, behold, I heard in fancy
Strains of one familiar song,
Often sung by my dear mother
To me in that cradle bed :
" Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber !
Holy angels guard thy bed ! "
    
4. While I listen to the music
Stealing on in gentle strain,
I am carried back to childhood —
I am now a child again :
'Tis the hour of my retiring,
At the dusky eventide ;
Near my cradle bed I'm kneeling,
As of yore, by mother's side.
    
5. Hands are on my head so loving,
As they were in childhood's days;
I, with weary tones, am trying
To repeat the words she says ;
'Tis a prayer in language simple
As a mother's lips can frame :
" Father, Thou who art in heaven,
Hallowed, ever, be Thy name."
    
6. Prayer is over : to my pillow
With a " good-night " kiss I creep,
Scarcely waking while I whisper,
" Now I lay me down to sleep."
Then my mother, o'er me bending,
Prays in earnest words, but mild :
" Hear my prayer, O heavenly Father,
Bless, oh bless, my precious child ! "
    
7. Yet I am but only dreaming :
Ne'er I'll be a child again ;
Many years has that dear mother
In the quiet graveyard lain ;
But her blessed angel spirit
Daily hovers o'er my head,
Calling me from earth to heaven,
Even from my cradle bed.</cantique>
